# CDDAEsoterica-BN-Pariah-Edit

This is a conversion of an old mod to allow it to work on BN. If you like it, go star the original please (https://github.com/glamcube17/CDDAEsoterica). It does what it says on the tin, adds in a lot of 'esoterica'. About the only changes I did were to remove some redundant makeshift walls files (can be grabbed from the original if you like) and knocked out the Lua stuff (which wasn't essential anyways, everything it did can be done with flags and qualities now).
Watch out for the Elegant Knife, it's a cursed item and while useful is, well, CURSED. You'll have to damage yourself to put it down.

The following is the original ReadMe:
